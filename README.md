Iris Flower Classification

This project aims to classify Iris flowers into three species based on their physical features: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica. The classification is performed using machine learning algorithms on the famous Iris dataset, which contains measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Iris dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It consists of 150 samples with 4 features each:

Sepal Length
Sepal Width
Petal Length
Petal Width
The target variable is the flower species, which can be one of the following:

Iris-setosa
Iris-versicolor
Iris-virginica
You can find the dataset here.
